- How does LLM work ?
  - LLM works by taking user inputs and generating responses using trained models that analyze patterns and relationships between words and phrases in large data sets. 
  - The models use algorithms and statistical methods to generate accurate and contextually appropriate responses.
  - **Memory/Context**: The LLM keeps in memory the context of the conversation/original discussion and takes it into account when formulating response
  - **Randomness/unpredictability**: This is built in feature/characteristic in LLM. If you keep asking the same question over and over, you will end up with a variety of answers. It may be very similar but not the same 
  - **What is prompt?** It s a message/input/cue that the LLM can leverage from the user to remember/build upon to formulate an interactive response
  - **Pattern of the prompt** is important: This sets the context, gives specificity, or direction how the output will be tailored and framed. Generic prompts will give more generic answers that may or may not be scoped enough
  - **The persona pattern**: ability of the model to generate responses consistent with particular persona or style, such as requesting a deep detailed, general info, specific language in industry, etcâ€¦
